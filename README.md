## About the project

We have seen a substantial growth in the amount of waste generated day by day. Recycling is the only way to reduce the amount of waste generated for the recycling to done it is important tht first the waste must be segregated first because recycling process differs.
In order to do that it is important to educate the user For this purpose we design a garbage disposal system that uses multiple dustbins. Face detection is done by the camera interface and with a voice based system that speaks to the user each time he or she stands before the dustbin.
Using ultrasonic sensor we detect the levels of the bin which is mounted inside the bin. As soon as the level of bin is full a  message is directed over the internet to empty the bin.
